    <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
    <h2>My Educational background</h2>
    <p>Primary School: Ponyways Academy 2002-2009</p>
    <p>High school: Kiaguthu Boys High School 2010-2014</p>
    <p>University: Taita Taveta University 2015-2020. I pursued a Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology</p>
    <h3>Why programming?</h3>
    <p>Since my early ages, I had an insatiable curiousity for technology and all its aspects.
      In high school, I developed a passion for computers and hence the decision to pursue a
      Bachelor's in Iformation Technology. In campus, I settled on application development as my chosen
      specialty and what I wanted to be my career. After completing campus, I joined Moringa School this year
      to pursue software engineering to gain soft skills, and to further explore different
      languages.

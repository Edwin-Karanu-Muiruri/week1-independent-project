    <p>Hi, I'm Edwin Karanu Muiruri. I develop Android applications, design android User Interfaces,
      and front-end websites.</p>
    <p>I have been developing Android applications for an year now. However, none of my projects
      have been uploaded to Google's Appstore yet.</p>
    <p>I began my journey of Web development last year(2019). This year, I have had the opportunity
    to learn more about web development from <a href="https://moringaschool.com/programs/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand-campaigns-Q4-2019&gclid=CjwKCAiA-P7xBRAvEiwAow-VaY3bjuLcP5vTh54RCYpfyvWtrujZ4m8BkaFO6Aji3_Uw2mdYvNT6_BoCtkUQAvD_BwE
    ">Moringa School<a/> where I have had the chance to work on a number of practice
  projects assigned by the school.</p>
    <p>Here is a list of some of the projects I have worked on:</p>
